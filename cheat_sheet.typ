== Continuity in $RR^n$

Let $x_0 in X subset.eq RR^n$ and $f: X -> RR^m$

=== Convergence

#def()[
  Let $(x_k)_(k in NN)$ where $x_k in RR^n$. Write $ x_k = (x_(k,1), ..., x_(k,n)) $
  Let $y = (y_1, ..., y_n) in RR^n$. We say that the sequence $(x_k)$ *converges* to $y$ as $k -> + infinity$ if $ forall epsilon > 0: exists N >= 1: forall k >= N: ||x_k-y|| < epsilon $
]

#lem()[
  The sequence $(x_k)$ converges to $y$ as $k -> + infinity$ iff#footnote("if and only if")one of the following *equivalent* conditions holds:
  + For each $i$, $i <= i <= n$, the sequence $(x_(k,i))$ of real numbers converges to $y_i$.
  + The sequence of real numbers $||x_k - y||$ converges to $0$ as $k -> + infinity$.
]

=== Continuity

#def()[
  + We say that $f$ is *continuous at $x_0$* if $forall epsilon > 0: exists delta > 0: forall x in X:$ $ ||x - x_0|| < delta ==> || f(x) - f(x_0) || < epsilon $
  + We say that $f$ is *continuous on $X$* if it is continuous at $x_0$ for all $x_0 in X$
]

#lem()[
  The function $f$ is continuous at $x_0$ iff, for every sequence $(x_k)_(k >= 1)$ in $X$ sucht that $x_k -> x_0$ as $k -> + infinity$, the sequence $(f(x_k))_(k >= 1)$ in $RR^m$ converges to $f(x)$.
]

=== Limit

Let $y in RR^m$.

#def()[
  We say that $f$ has the *limit* $y$ as $x -> x_0$ with $x != x_0$ if $ forall epsilon > 0: exists delta > 0: forall x in X: x != x_0 : $
  $
    ||x - x_0|| < delta => || f(x) - y || < epsilon
  $
  We then write $ limit f(x) = y $
]

#lem()[
  We have $ limit f(x) = y $ iff, for every sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$ sucht that $x_k -> x_0$ as $k -> + infinity$, and $x_k != x_0$, the sequence $(f(x_k))$ in $RR^m$ converges to $y$.
]

#lem()[
  Let $Y subset.eq RR^m$ and $p >= 1$ an integer. Let $f: X -> Y$ and $g: Y -> RR^p$ be continuous functions. Then the composite *$g compose f$* is continuous.
]

=== Bounds

#def()[
  + A subset $x subset.eq RR^n$ is *bounded* if the set of $||x||$ for $x in X$ is bounded in $RR$.
  + A subset $X subset.eq RR^n$ is *closed* if for every sequence $(x_k)$ in $X$ that converges in $RR^n$ to some vector $y in RR^n$, we have $y in X$.
  + A subset $X subset.eq RR^n$ is *compact* if it is bounded and closed.
]

#lem()[
  Let $f: RR^n -> RR^m$ be a continuous map. For any closed set $Y subset.eq RR^m$, the set
  $ f^(-1)(Y) = {x in RR^n: f(x) in Y} subset.eq RR^n $
  is closed.
]

#lem()[
  Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be a non-empty compact set and $f: X -> RR$ a continuous function. Then $f$ is bounded and achieves its *maximum* and *minimum*, or in other words, there exist $x_+$ and $x_-$ in $X$, such that
  $ f(x_+) = sup_(x in X) f(x), space.quad f(x_-) = inf_(x in X) f(x) $
]

== Partial Derivatives

Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be an open set.

=== Openness

#def()[
  A subset $X subset.eq RR^n$ is *open* if, for any $x = (x_1, ..., x_n) in X$, there exists $delta > 0$ such that the set $ {y = (y_1, ..., y_n) in RR^n : |x_i - y_i| < delta "for all" i} $ is contained in $X$.

  In other words: any point of $RR^n$ obtained by changing any coordinate of $x$ by at most $delta$ is still in $X$.
]

#lem()[
  A set $X subset.eq RR^n$ is *open* iff the complement $ Y = {x in RR^n : x in.not X} $ is closed.
]

#lem()[
  If $f: RR^n -> RR^m$ is continuous and $Y subset.eq RR^m$ is open, then $f^(-1)(Y)$ is open in $RR^n$.
]

=== Derivative

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR$ be a function. Let $1 <= i <= n$. We say that $f$ has a *partial derivative* on $X$ with respect to the $i$-th variable, or coordinate, if for all $x_0 = (x_(0,1), ..., x_(0,n) in X)$ the function defined by $ g(t) = f(x_(0,1), ..., x_(0,i-1), t, x_(0, i+1), ..., x_(0,n)) $ on the set $ I = {t in RR: (x_(0,1), ..., x_(0,i-1), t, x_(0, i+1), ..., x_(0,n)) in X} $ is differentiable at $t = x_(0,i)$. Its derivative $g'(x_(0,i))$ at $x_(0,i)$ is denoted $ ((diff f)/(diff x_i))(x_0), space.quad diff_(x_i) f(x_0), space.quad diff_i f(x_0) $

  _Intuitively, this definition means that we "freeze" all variables except the $i$-th one, and consider the derivative of the corresponding function of one variable._
]

#lem()[
  Let $f$, $g$ be functions from $X$ to $RR$. Let $1 <= i <= n$.
  + If $f$ and $g$ have partial derivatives with respect to the $i$-th coordinate on $X$, then $f+g$ also does, and $ diff_(x_i)(f+g) = diff_(x_i)(f) + diff_(x_i)(g) $
  + If $m=1$, and if $f$ and $g$ have partial derivatives with respect to the $i$-th coordinate on $X$, then
    + $f dot g$ also does and $ diff_(x_i)(f dot g) = diff_(x_i)(f) dot g + f dot diff_(x_i)(g) $
    + if $g(x) != 0$ for all $x in X$, then $f/g$ has a partial derivative with respect to the $i$-th coordinate on $X$, with $ diff_(x_i)(f/g) = (diff_(x_i)(f) dot g - f dot diff_(x_i)(g))/g^2 $
]

=== Jacobi Matrix

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function with partial derivatives on $X$. Write
  $ f(x) = (f_1 (x), ..., f_m (x)) $
  For any $x in X$, the matrix
  $ J_f(x) = (diff_(x_j) f_i (x))_(1 <= i <= m)^(1 <= j <=n) $
  with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is called the *Jacobi matrix* of $f$ at $x$.
]

=== Gradient

#def()[
  + Let $f: X -> RR$ be a function. If all partial derivatives of $f$ exists at $x_0 in X$, then the column vector $ mat(diff_(x_1) f(x_0); ...; diff_(x_n) f(x_0)) $ if called the *gradient* of $f$ at $x_0$, and is denoted $gradient f(x_0)$.
  + Let $f = (f_1, ..., f_n): X -> RR^n$ be a function with values in $RR^n$ sucht that all partial derivatives of all coordinates $f_i$ of $f$ exists at $x_0 in X$. Then the real number $ "Tr"(J_f (x_0)) = sum^n_(i=1) diff_(x_i) f_i (x_0), $ the trace of the Jacobi matrix, is called the *divergence* of $f$ at $x_0$, and is denoted $"div"(f)(x_0)$.
]

== The Differential

Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be an open set.

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function. Let $u$ be a linear map $RR^n -> RR^m$ and $x_0 in X$. We say that $f$ is *differentiable at $x_0$ with differential u* if
  $ attach(lim, tr: x -> x_0, br: x != x_0) (f(x) - f(x_0) - u(x-x_0)) / (||x - x_0||) = 0 $
  where the limit is in $RR^m$. We then denote $d f (x_0) = u$.

  If $f$ is differentiable at every $x_0 in X$, then we say that $f$ is differentiable on $X$.

  _This definition means that, close to $x_0$ , we can approximate $f(x)$ by the affine#footnote()["An affine function is the composition of a linear function with a translation" - so the vectors do not have to go through $(0,0)$, the origin]-linear function $g: RR^n -> RR^m$ defined by $g(x) = f(x_0) + u(x-x_0)$ with an error that becomes much smaller than $||x-x_0||$ as $x$ gets close to $x_0$._
]

#lem()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function that is differentiable on $X$.
  + The function $f$ is continuous on $X$.
  + The function $f = (f_1, ..., f_m)$ admits all partial derivatives $diff_(x_j) f_i$ for $1 <= i <= m$, $1 <= j <= n$ on $X$.
  + Assume that $m = 1$. Let $x_0 in X$, and let $u(x_1, ..., x_n) = a_1 x_1 + ... + a_n x_n$ be the differential of $f$ at $x_0$. We then have $diff_(x_i) f(x_0) = a_i$ for $1 <= i <= n$.
]

#lem()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ and $g: X -> RR^m$ be differentiable functions on $X$.
  + The function $f+g$ is differentiable with differential $d (f+g) = d f + d g$, and if $m = 1$, then $f dot g$ is differentiable.
  + If $m = 1$ and of $g(x) != 0$ for all $x in X$, then $f / g$ is differentiable.
]

#lem()[
  Let $f : X -> RR^m$ be a function on $X$. If $f$ has all partial derivatives on $X$, and if the partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous on $X$, then $f$ is differentiable on $X$ with differential determined by its partial derivatives, in the sense that the matrix of the differential $d f(x_0)$, with respect to the canonical basis of $RR^n$ and $RR^m$, is the *Jacobi matrix* of $f$ at $x_0$.

  _So in simpler terms: The Jacobi matrix is the differential._
]

#lem()[
  Let $Y subset.eq RR^m$ be open and let $f: X -> Y$ and $g: Y -> RR^p$ be differentiable functions. Then $g compose f: X -> RR^p$ is differentiable on $X$, and for any $x_0 in X$, its differential is given by the composition
  $ d (g compose f)(x_0) = d g (f(x_0)) compose d f(x_0) $
  In particular, the Jacobi matrix satisfies
  $ J_(g compose f) (x_0) = J_g (f(x_0)) J_f (x_0) $
  where the right-hand side is a matrix product.
]

=== Tangent Space

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function that is differentiable. Let $x_0 in X$ and $u = d f(x_0)$ be a differential of $f$ at $x_0$. The graph of the affine linear approximation
  $ g(x) = f(x_0) + u(x - x_0) $
  from $RR^n$ to $RR^m$, or in other words the set
  $ {(x,y) in RR^n times RR^m: y = f(x_0) + u(x-x_0)} $
  is called the *tangent space* at $x_0$ to the graph of $f$.
]

=== Directional Derivative

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function. Let $v in RR^n$ be a non-zero vector and $x_0 in X$. We say that $f$ has *directional derivative* $w in RR^m$ in the direction $v$, if the function $g: I -> RR^m$ defined on the set $I = {t in RR: x_0 + t v in X}$ by $g(t) + f(x_0 + t v)$ has a derivative at $t = 0$, and this is equal to $w$. We write this as $D_v f = w$.
]

#lem()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$ be a differentiable function. Then for any $x in X$ and non-zero $v in RR^n$, the function $f$ has a directional derivative at $x_0$ in the direction $v$, equal to $d f(x_0)(v)$.
  \
  \
  _What is important to notice in this proposition, is that the
values of the directional derivatives are linear with respect to the vector $v$._
]

== Higher Derivatives

Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be an open set.

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR^m$.
  We say that $f$ is of class $C^1$ if $f$ is differentiable on $X$ and all its partial derivatives are continuous. The set of functions of class $C^1$ from $X$ to $RR^m$ is denoted $C^1 (X;RR^m)$.

  Let $k >= 2$. We say, by induction, that $f$ is of class $C^k$ if it is differentiable and each partial derivative $diff_(x_i) f : X -> RR^m$ is of class $C^(k-1)$. The set of functions of class *$C^k$* from $X$ to $RR^m$ is denoted $C^k (X; RR^m)$.

  If $f in C^k (X; RR^m)$ for all $k >= 1$, then we say that $f$ is of class $C^infinity$. The set of sucht functions is denoted $C^infinity (X; RR^m)$.
]

#lem()[
  Let $K >= 2$ and $f: X -> RR^m$ be a function of class $C^k$. Then the partial derivatives of order $k$ are independent of the order in which the partial derivatives are taken: for any variables x and y, we have:
  $ diff_(x,y) f = diff_(y,x) f, $
  and for any variables $x$, $y$, $z$, we have
  $ diff_(x,y,z) f = diff_(x,z,y) f = diff_(y,z,x) f = diff_(z,x,y) f = ... $
  etc...
]

=== Hessian Matrix

#def()[
  Let $f: X -> RR$ a $C^2$ function. For $x in X$, the *Hessian matrix* of $f$ at $x$ is the *symmetric square* matrix
  $ "Hess"_f (x) = (diff_(x_i , x_j) f(x))_(1 <= i,j <= n) $
  We also sometimes write simply $H_f (x)$.
]

== Taylor Polynomials

Let $k >= 1$ be an integer. Let $f: X -> RR$ be a function of class $C^k$ on $X$, and fix $x_0 in X$.

#def()[
  The $k$-th *Taylor polynomial* of $f$ at the point $x_0$ is the polynomial in $n$ variables of degree $<=k$ given by
  $
    T_k f(y;x_0) = f(x_0) + sum^n_(i=1) (diff f) / (diff x_i) (x_0) y_i + ... \ + sum_(m_1 + ... + m_n = k) 1 / (m_1 ! dots.c m_n !) (diff^k f) / (diff x_1^(m_1) dots.c diff x_n^(m_n)) (x_0) y_1^(m_1) dots.c y_n^(m_n)
  $
  where the last sum ranges over the tuples of $n$ non-negative integers such that the sum is $k$.

  ==== *$k = 1$*
  $ T_1 f(y; x_0) = f(x_0) + sum^n_(i=1) diff_(x_i) f(x_0) y_i $

  ==== *$k = 2$*
  $
    T_2 f(y; x_0) &= f(x_0) &&+ sum^n_(i=1) diff_(x_i) f(x_0) y_i \ & &&+ 1 / 2 sum^n_(i=1) diff^2_(x^2_i) f(x_0) y_i^2 \ & &&+ sum_(1 <= i < j <= n) diff^2_(x_i x_j) f(x_0) y_i y_j \
    &= f(x_0) &&+ gradient f(x_0) dot y + 1 / 2 y^t "Hess"_f (x_0) y
  $
  _Note that this can also be used to easily *calculate the Hesse Matrix* from a known Taylor polynomial._
]

#lem()[
  If we define $E_k f(x; x_0)$ by $ f(x) = T_k f(x - x_0; x_0) + E_k f(x; x_0) $ then we have $ lim^(x -> x_0)_(x != x_0) (E_k f(x; x_0))/(||x-x_0||^k) = 0. $
]

#note()[
  When we want to find the Taylor Polynomial of $n$-th order of a function that consists of other functions with already known (Taylor) Polynomials, we can just replace each function with their respective Taylor Polynomial and "ignore" all terms with order higher than $n$.
]

== Critical Points

Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be open and $f: X -> RR$ a differentiable function.

#lem()[
  If $x_0 in X$ is such that
  - $f(y) <= f(x_0)$ for all $y$ close enough to $x_0$ (local maximum at $x_0$) _or_
  - $f(y) >= f(x_0)$ for all $y$ close enough to $x_0$ (local minimum of $x_0$).
  Then we have $d f(x_0) = 0$, or in other words $gradient f(x_0) = 0$, or equivalently $(diff f) / (diff x_i) (x_0) = 0$ for $1 <= i <= n$.
]

#def()[
  A point $x_0 in X$ such that $gradient f (x_0)$ is called a *critical point* of the function $f$.
]

#def()[
  Let $f in C^2$. A critical point $x_0 in X$ of $f$ is called *non-degenerate* if the Hessian matrix has non-zero determinant.
]

#lem()[
  Let $f in C^2$. Let $x_0$ be a non-degenerate critical point of $f$. Let $p$ and $q$ be the number of positive and negative eigenvalues#footnote()[can be derived using the formulas in the eigenvalues section] of $"Hess"_f (x_0)$.
  + If $p = n$, equivalently if $q = 0$, the function $f$ has a *local minimum* at $x_0$.
  + If $q = n$, equivalently if $p = 0$, the function $f$ has a *local maximum* at $x_0$.
  + Otherwise, equivalent if $p q != 0$, the function $f$ does not have a local extremum at $x_0$. One then says that $f$ has a *saddle point* at $x_0$.
  \
  \
  The condition $ p = n$ means that the Hessian matrix $H$ at $x_0$ is a *positive definite symmetric matrix* (and $q = n$ means that it is a negative definite matrix). This also means that $y^t H y > 0$ for any non-zero vector $y in RR^n$. When $p q != 0$, the Hessian is also said to be *indefinite*.

Moreover, the Jacobian of $g$ at $x_0$ is determined by $ J_g (f(x_0)) = J_f (x_0)^(-1). $ In addition, if $f$ is of class $C^k$, then $g$ is of class $C^k$.

== Implicit Function Theorem

== Ordinary Differential Equations

_A differential equation is an equation where the unknown (or unknowns) is a function $f$, and the equation relates values of $f$ at a point $x$ with values of derivatives of the function at the same point $x$. If the function has one variable only, one speaks of ordinary differential equations._

#def()[
  Suppose $F: RR^2 -> RR$ is a continuously differentiable function of two variables. Let $x_0 in RR$ and $y_0 in RR$. Then the *ordinary differential equation* $ y' = F(x,y) $ has a unique solution $f$ defined on a "largest" open interval $I$ containing $x_0$ such that $f(x_0) = y_0$. In other words, there exists $I$ and a function $f: I -> RR$ such that for all $x in I$, we have $f'(x) = F(x, f(x))$, and one cannot find a larger interval containing $I$ with such a solution.
]

== Linear Differential Equations

#def()[

== (Solving) Linear Differential Equations Of Order 1

#note()[
  Let $I subset.eq RR$ be an open interval. We consider the linear differential equation $ y' + a y = b, $ when $a$ and $b$ are general continuous functions defined on $I$

  The solution has two steps:
  + Solving the homogeneous equation $y' + a y = 0$.
  + Finding a solution $f_'$ of the inhomogeneous equation, so that the set $S_b$ contains exactly the functions $f_0 + f$ where $f in S$.

  === Step 1 (solving the homogeneous equation)

#def()[
  + Let $I = [a, b]$ be a closed and bounded interval in $RR$. Let $f(t) = (f_1 (t), ..., f_n (t))$ be a continuous function from $I$ to $RR^n$, i.e., $f_i$ is continuous for $1 <= i <= n$. Then we define $ integral^b_a f(t) d t = (integral^b_a f_1 (t) d t, ..., integral^b_a f_n (t) d t) in RR^n. $
  + A *parameterized curve* in $RR^n$ is a continuous map $gamma : [a, b] -> RR^n$ that is piecewise $C^1$, i.e., there exists $k >= 1$ and a partition $ a = t_0 < t_1 < dots.c < t_(k-1) < t_k = b $ such that the restriction of $gamma$ to $] t_(j-1), t_j [$ is $C^1$ for $1 <= j <= k$.

It is denoted $ integral_gamma f(s) dot d s space.quad "or" space.quad integral_gamma f(s) dot d arrow(s). $
]

#lem()[
  The integral of continuous functions $I -> RR^n$ satisfy much of the same rules as the Riemann integral of a function $I -> RR$, for instance $ integral^b_a (f(t) + g(t)) d t = integral^b_a f(t) d t + integral^b_a g(t) d t. $ Also, as in the one-variable case, we define $ integral^a_b f(t) d t = - integral^b_a f(t) d t, $ if $a < b$.

  In the line integral, $gamma'(t)$ and $f(gamma(t))$ are both vectors in $RR^n$ for all $t$, so that the final integral is a real number.

  It is customary, when working with line integrals, to say that the function $f: X -> RR^n$ is a *vector field*: a function that sends each point $x$ in $X subset.eq RR^n$ to a vector in $RR^n$, which we display as based at $x$.

=== Reparameterization

#def()[

An *oriented reparameterization* of $gamma$ is a parameterized curve $sigma : [c,d] -> RR^n$ such that $sigma = gamma compose phi$, where $phi : [c, d] -> [a, b]$ is a continuous map, differentiable on $]c,d[$, that is strictly increasing and satisfies $phi (c) = a$ and $phi (d) = b$.

Let $X$ be a set containing the image of $gamma$, or equivalently the image of $sigma$, and $f: X -> RR^n$ a continuous function. Then we have $ integral_gamma f(s) dot d arrow(s) = integral_sigma f(s) dot d arrow(s). $
]

#def()[

If, for any $x_1$, $x_2$ in $X$, the line integral $ integral_gamma f(s) dot d arrow(s) $ is independent of the choice of a parameterized curve $gamma$ in $X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$, then we say that the vector field is *conservative*.
]

#lem()[

]

#lem()[

  If any two points of $X$ can be joined by a parameterized curve#footnote([so if $X$ is path-connected, so when $X$ is convex]), then $g$ is unique up to addition of a constant: if $gradient g_1 = f$, then $g - g_1$ is constant on $X$.

  If $f$ is a conservative vector field on $X$, then a function $g$ such that $gradient g = f$ is called a *potential* for $f$.

#lem()[

]

#def()[A subset $X subset.eq RR^n$ is *star shaped* if there exists $x_0 in X$ such that, for all $x in X$, the line segment joining $x_0$ to $x$ is contained in $X$. We then also say that $X$ is star-shaped around $x_0$.]

]

=== Curl

#def()[
  Let $X subset.eq RR^3$ be an open set and $f: X -> RR^3$ a $C^1$ vector field. Then the curl of $f$, denoted $"curl"(f)$, is the continuous vector field on $X$ defined by $ "curl"(f) = vec(diff_y f_3 - diff_z f_2, diff_z f_1 - diff_x f_3, diff_x f_2 - diff_y f_1), $ where $f(x,y,z) = (f_1 (x,y,z), f_2 (x,y,z), f_3 (x,y,z))$.

#lem()[

== The Riemann Integral in $RR^n$

#def()[
  For any bounded closed subset $X subset.eq RR^n$ and any continuous function $f: X -> RR$, one can define the *integral of $f$ over $X$*, denoted $ integral_X f(x) d x, $ which is a real number, depending of course on $X$ and on $f$.
]

#lem()[
  === Compatibility

  If $n = 1$ and $X = [a, b]$ is an interval, then the integral of $f$ over $X$ is the Riemann integral of $f$: $ integral_([a, b]) f(x) d x = integral^b_a f(x) d x. $

  === Linearity

  If $f$ and $g$ are continuous on $X$ and $a$, $b$ are real numbers, then $ integral_X (a f_1 (x) + b f_2 (x)) d x = \ a integral_X f_1 (x) d x + b integral_X f_2 (x) d x. $

  === Positivity

  If $f <= g$, then $ integral_X f(x) d x <= integral_X g(x) d x $ and especially, if $f >= 0$, then $ integral_X f(x) d x >= 0. $ Moreover, if $Y subset.eq X$ is compact and $f >= 0$, then $ integral_Y f(x) d x <= integral_X f(x) d x. $

  === Upper Bound And Triangle Inequality

  In particular, since $-|f| <= f <= |f|$, we have $ |integral_X f(x) d x| <= integral_X |f(x)| d x, $ and since $|f+g| <= |f| + |g|$, we have $ |integral_X (f(x) + g(x)) d x| <= integral_X |f(x)| d x + integral_X|g(x)| d x. $

  === Volume

  If $f = 1$, then the integral of $f$ is the *volume* in $RR^n$ of the set $X$, and if $f >= 0$ in general, the integral of $f$ is the volume of the set $ {(x,y) in X times RR : 0 <= y <= f(x)} subset.eq RR^(n+1). $ In particular, if $X$ is a bounded rectangle, say $ X = [a_1, b_1] times dots.c times [a_n, b_n] subset.eq RR^n $ and $f = 1$, then $ integral_X d x = (b_n - a_n) dots.c (b_1 - a_1). $ We write $"Vol"(X)$ or $"Vol"_(n)(X)$ for the volume of $X$.

  === Multiple Integral / Fubini's Theorem

  If $n_1$ and $n_2$ are integers $>= 1$ such that $n = n_1 + n_2$, then for $x_1 in RR^(n_1)$, let $ Y_(x_1) = {x_2 in RR^(n_2) : (x_1, x_2) in X} subset.eq RR^(n_2). $ Let $X_1$ be the set of $x_1 in RR^n$ such that $Y_(x_1)$ is not empty. Then $X_1$ is compact in $RR^(n_1)$ and $Y_(x_1)$ is compact in $RR^(n_2)$ for all $x_1 in X_1$. If the function $ g(x_1) = integral_(Y_(x_1)) f(x_1, x_2) d x_2 $ on $X_1$ is continuous, then $ integral_X f(x_1, x_2) d x = integral_(X_1) g(x_1) d x_1 = \ integral_(X_1) (integral_(Y_(x_1)) f(x_1, x_2) d x_2) d x_1. $ Similarly, exchanging the role of $x_1$ and $x_2$, we have $ integral_X f(x_1, x_2) d x = integral_(X_2) (integral_(Z_(x_2)) f(x_1, x_2) d x_1) d x_2, $ where $Z_(x_2) = {x_1 : (x_1, x_2) in X}$, if the integral over $x_1$ is a continuous function.

  ==== Special Cases

  / $X = X_1 times X_2$: Assuming $X_1 subset.eq RR^(n_1)$, $X_2 subset.eq RR^(n_2)$, $f$ is continuous and $Y_(x_1) = {x_2 in RR^(n_2): (x_1, x_2) in X_1 times X_2} = X_2 subset.eq RR^(n_2)$, then $ integral_(X_1 times X_2) f(x_1, x_2) d x_1 d x_2 = \ integral_(X_1) (integral_(X_2) f(x_1, x_2) d x_2) d x_1 = \ integral_(X_2) (integral_(X_1) f(x_1, x_2) d x_1) d x_2. $
  / $X = [a_1, b_1] times dots.c times [a_n, b_n] subset.eq RR^n$: Assuming $f(x_1, ..., x_n) = f_1 (x_1) dots.c f_n (x_n)$ and each $f_i$ is continuous, then $ integral_X f(x_1, ..., x_n) d x_1 dots.c d x_n = \ (integral^(b_1)_(a_1) f_1 (x) d x) dots.c (integral^(b_n)_(a_n) f_n (x) d x) $

  === Domain Additivity

  If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are compact subsets of $RR^n$, and $f$ is continuous on $X_1 union X_2$, then $ integral_(X_1 union X_2) f(x) d x + integral_(X_1 sect X_2) f(x) d x = \ integral_(X_1) f(x) d x + integral_(X_2) f(x) d x. $
  If $X_1 sect X_2$ is *empty*, then $X_1 union X_2$, then $ integral_(X_1 union X_2) f(x) d x = integral_(X_1) f(x) d x + integral_(X_2) f(x) d x. $
]

=== Negligibleness

#def()[
  + Let $1 <= m <= b$ be an integer. A *parameterized $m$-set* in $RR^n$ is a continuous map $ f: [a_1, b_1] times dots.c times [a_m, b_m] -> RR^n $ which is $C^1$ on $ ]a_1, b_1[ times dots.c times ]a_b, b_m [ . $
  + A subset $B subset.eq RR^n$ is *negligible* if there exist an integer $k >= 0$ and parameterized $m_i$-sets $f_i : X_i -> RR^n$, with $1 <= i <= k$ and $m_i < n$, such that $ B subset.eq f_1 (X_1) union dots.c union f_k (X_k). $

#lem()[
  - Any subset of the real axis $RR times {0} subset.eq RR^2$ is negligible in $RR^2$.
  - If $H subset.eq RR^n$ is an affine subspace of dimension $m < n$, then any subset of $RR^n$ that is contained in $H$ is negligible.
  - The image of a parameterized curve $gamma : [a,b] -> RR^n$ is negligible, since $gamma$ is a $1$-set in $RR^n$.
]

#lem()[
  Let $X subset.eq RR^n$ be a compact set. Assume that $X$ is negligible. Then for any continuous function on $X$, we have $ integral_X f(x) d x = 0. $
]

== Improper Integrals

#def()[
  Let $f$ be continuous on $RR^2$. Assume that $f >= 0$. We say that $f$ is Riemann-integrable on $RR^2$, if the limit $ lim_(R -> + infinity) integral_([-R, R]^2) f(x, y) d x d y $ exists, which is then called the *integral of $f$ over $RR^2$* and denoted $ integral_(RR^2) f(x,y) d x d y. $

  One can then show that this integral is also the limit of $ integral_(D_R) f(x,y) d x d y$ where $D_R$ is the disc of radius $R$ centered at $0$.

  Also $ integral_(RR^2) f(x,y) d x d y = \ integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) (integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) f(x, y) d y) d x = \ integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) (integral^(+ infinity)_(- infinity) f(x, y) d x) d y. $

== The Change Of Variable Formula

#def()[
  Let $dash(X) subset.eq RR^n$ and $dash(Y) subset.eq RR^n$ be compact subsets. Let $phi : dash(X) -> dash(Y)$ be a continuous map. We assume that we can write $dash(X) = X union B$ and $dash(Y) = Y union C$ where
  + the sets $X$ and $Y$ are open;
  + the sets $B$ and $C$ are negligible;
  + the restriction of $phi$ to the open set $X$ is a $C^1$ bijective map from $X$ to $Y$.

  In this situation, the Jacobian matrix $J_phi (x)$ is invertible at all $x in X$; we assume that we can find a continuous function on $dash(X)$ that restricts to $det (J_phi (x))$ on $X$. We abuse notation and still write $det (J_phi (x))$ for this function, even if $x in B$.
  \
  \
  In the situation described above, for any continuous function $f$ on $dash(Y)$, we have $ integral_(dash(X)) f(phi (x)) | det (J_phi (x)) | d x = integral_(dash(Y)) f(y) d y. $
